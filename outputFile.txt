The waitress told us that The Farm Burger is the most popular. I for one have never had a burger with an egg and the thought of it isn't very appealing. \n\nI ended up ordering the 'Pharmacy Burger', which is a less cheesier version of their 'Cheese Burger' that my husband ordered. They LOADED the mustard, but that really wasn't what I didn't like about it. It really wasn't that I disliked the burger, it just wasn't anywhere near one of the best burgers that I've had. The extra toppings at fifty cents each are pretty skimpy too. I was a fan of the wasabi aioli though. I also loved the tater tots though. I highly recommend ordering tater tots over the french fries. The beer cheese dipping sauce was an extra dollar and was borderline disgusting. Stick with wasabi aioli. \n\nI'm thinking that the toppings and sauces are possibly what the hype about this place is, otherwise, I just don't get it. To describe this place in one word... overhyped.\",\"date\":\"2018-01-02 22:50:47\"}
